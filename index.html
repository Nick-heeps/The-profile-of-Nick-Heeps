			  <h1 style="font-familty:calibri;" > The Profile of Nick Heeps </h1>
			  <p style="font-family:verdana;" style = "text-align:center;" >Hey, my name is Nick. My student number is s3944165 and my student email is s3944165@student.rmit.edu.au.</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;" style = "text-align:center;" >I’m a new student here at RMIT and I’m currently studying the Bachelor of Information technology and I’m on campus 4 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday).</p>  
<p style="font-family:verdana;" style = "text-align:center;" >Even though my whole extended family lives in Melbourne I only moved here this year. I originally lived on a farm just outside a small town called Barnawartha. So yeah, moving to Melbourne was a massive change for me. 
I actually have good internet for a change. I went to school at Victory Lutheran college which definitely isn’t the largest school as I only had 30 people in my year 12 class. 
I have a lot of hobbies, but my main ones are probably building computers, gaming and listening to music (I had 147,780 minutes listened on 2021 Spotify wrapped). 
It wasn’t until about 2 weeks of me living in Melbourne when I realized I needed a myki card to get on trams so yeah, I’m a bit of a country boy. </p>

				<h2 style="font-family:verdana;" style="font-size:250%;" style="text-align:center;"> Interest in IT</h2>
			</header>
			<p style="font-family:verdana;" style="text-align:center;" > My interest in IT began when I got my first PC in 2016 for my birthday. 
			I had been constantly nagging my parents if I could get one because all my friends had one, they eventually caved and got me a very baseline, beginner gaming PC, containing an Intel i3 6100, a Radeon R7 360 graphics card and 8gb of ram.
			Ever since then I have had a very strong interest with the physical and hardware side of IT. I’ve taken apart and rebuilt my PC countless times with new parts to get it to where it is today. 
			I now want to expand my IT knowledge into more of the hardware side like dealing with servers, security systems or even with robotics.</p>
			
			<p style="font-family:verdana;" style = "text-align:center;" >I’ve had a medium amount of IT experience, both within school and outside of school. 
			In year 10 and year 11, I undertook data analysis and computing as an early start year 12 subject, there I learned a lot of the basics to do with IT while also gaining a lot of skills to help me with further education and life in general.
			I also participated in work experience at MARS Petcare where I worked with the IT department for two weeks handling small tasks and jobs so I could get an idea of what it was like to work in the IT field. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="font-family:verdana;">I chose to come to RMIT because of the extensive and well-structured IT and computing courses that they had in place, allowing for me to pursue my interest in IT no matter what ATAR I got after leaving school.
			My brother also goes to RMIT, and he said that it’s a great environment to attend university and provides amazing resources to assist in me while undertaking my classes. </p>
			
			<pstyle="font-family:verdana;">I expect to learn all about the different areas of IT throughout my course, not only to help me find a job when I’m older but to also build on my skills to use in everyday life. 
			I also want to use these studies to help me grow as a person and build my life skills by working with people I’ve never met before, overcoming challenges and learning new ways to tackle problems that I come across.</p>
