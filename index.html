				<h1> <u> The Profile of Nick Heeps </u> </h1>
<p > Hey , my name is Nick. My student number is s3944165 and my student email is s3944165@student.rmit.edu.au.</p>
<p >I’m a new student here at RMIT and I’m currently studying the Bachelor of Information technology and I’m on campus 4 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday).</p>  
<p >Even though my whole extended family lives in Melbourne I only moved here this year. I originally lived on a farm just outside a small town called Barnawartha. So yeah, moving to Melbourne was a massive change for me,
I actually have good internet!!! I went to school at Victory Lutheran college which definitely isn’t the largest school as I only had 30 people in my year 12 class. 
I have a lot of hobbies, but my main ones are probably building computers, gaming and listening to music (I had 147,780 minutes listened on 2021 Spotify wrapped). 
It wasn’t until about 2 weeks of me living in Melbourne when I realized I needed a myki card to get on trams so yeah, I’m a bit of a country boy. </p>

				<h1> <u> Interest in IT</u> </h1>

			</header>
<div class="row">
 <div class="column"> <p > My interest in IT began when I got my first PC in 2016 for my birthday. 
I had been constantly nagging my parents if I could get one because all my friends had one, they eventually caved and got me a very baseline, beginner gaming PC, containing an Intel i3 6100, a Radeon R7 360 graphics card and 8gb of ram.
Ever since then I have had a very strong interest with the physical and hardware side of IT. I’ve taken apart and rebuilt my PC countless times with new parts to get it to where it is today. 
I now want to expand my IT knowledge into more of the hardware side like dealing with servers, security systems or even with robotics.</p>

  <div class="column"> 
	  <p  >I’ve had a medium amount of IT experience, both within school and outside of school. 
			In year 10 and year 11, I undertook data analysis and computing as an early start year 12 subject, there I learned a lot of the basics to do with IT while also gaining a lot of skills to help me with further education and life in general.
			I also participated in work experience at MARS Petcare where I worked with the IT department for two weeks handling small tasks and jobs so I could get an idea of what it was like to work in the IT field. 
			</p> 
	</div>
</div>
			
			
			
			<p >I chose to come to RMIT because of the extensive and well-structured IT and computing courses that they had in place, allowing for me to pursue my interest in IT no matter what ATAR I got after leaving school.
			My brother also goes to RMIT, and he said that it’s a great environment to attend university and provides amazing resources to assist in me while undertaking my classes. </p>
			
			<p >I expect to learn all about the different areas of IT throughout my course, not only to help me find a job when I’m older but to also build on my skills to use in everyday life. 
			I also want to use these studies to help me grow as a person and build my life skills by working with people I’ve never met before, overcoming challenges and learning new ways to tackle problems that I come across.</p>

				<h1> <u> Ideal Job </u> </h1>
			</header>
			<p > My ideal job is being a systems administrator. It involves working with the computer systems of a business such as this one listed called Kyndryl.
			Being a systems administrator basically means  working with the day-to-day operations of the businesses computing side.  </p>
			<p > This can involve installing networks, building and managing operating systems and troubleshooting any problems that the computer systems come across. 
			This is appealing for me as I love to work on different systems and finding out how to fix them or make them function properly. 
			To be a candidate for this position there is a set of essential skills that are required to work for the business. </p>
			<p > These involve a fluent understanding of the AIX operating system, being able to work flexible hours and being able to work strongly both within a team and independently. 
			It also requires experience with AIX and Redhat Linux administration to be considered for a position. 
			To be required for this position at Kyndryl I would have to work in another position that uses AIX operating systems and allows me to gain a firm understanding on how to navigate and work on those systems.  </p>
			<p > If not, I would have to learn myself how to do it. Skills such as following duties, working as a team, being able to communicate easily and being flexible should be fairly easy as I believe I have a strong set of those skills and If I were to get the position at Kyndryl I think I would fit in pretty well.

	<h1> <u> Online Testing </u> </h1>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="column"> <p> <b> Myers-brigg's test </b> <br> <img src="16 personalitys.PNG" alt="myers briggs test" /> </p>
		</div>
		<div class="column"> I think these tests will influence my behavior within a team as I will be aware of how I function towards others and myself. 
		As I am more introverted, I may find it a bit harder to put my own inputs in to the group, but once I feel comfortable around them and can open up, I know that I would be a good asset to the team. 
It would be better that I am in a team that isn’t all exactly like me, because that way I would be able to learn how other people work in group settings and also learn how I work in different group settings. 
If everyone was introverted, it could be hard for things to get done properly without good group communication, whereas, if there a few extroverted group members, it would be easier for me to feel comfortable as it would boost my confidence when others include me.
