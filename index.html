         <p > Hey , my name is Nick. My student number is s3944165 and my student email is s3944165@student.rmit.edu.au. I’m a new student here at RMIT and I’m currently studying the Bachelor of Information technology and I’m on campus 4 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday).</p> </div>

	<p >Even though my whole extended family lives in Melbourne I only moved here this year. I originally lived on a farm just outside a small town called Barnawartha. So yeah, moving to Melbourne was a massive change for me,
I actually have good internet!!! I went to school at Victory Lutheran college which definitely isn’t the largest school as I only had 30 people in my year 12 class. 
I have a lot of hobbies, but my main ones are probably building computers, gaming and listening to music (I had 147,780 minutes listened on 2021 Spotify wrapped). 
It wasn’t until about 2 weeks of me living in Melbourne when I realized I needed a myki card to get on trams so yeah, I’m a bit of a country boy. </p> </div>

				<h1> <u> Interest in IT</u> </h1>

			</header>
<div class="row">
 <div class="column" > <p > My interest in IT began when I got my first PC in 2016 for my birthday. 
I had been constantly nagging my parents if I could get one because all my friends had one, they eventually caved and got me a very baseline, beginner gaming PC, containing an Intel i3 6100, a Radeon R7 360 graphics card and 8gb of ram.
Ever since then I have had a very strong interest with the physical and hardware side of IT. I’ve taken apart and rebuilt my PC countless times with new parts to get it to where it is today. 
I now want to expand my IT knowledge into more of the hardware side like dealing with servers, security systems or even with robotics.</p>
	</div>
 		
  <div class="column"  > 
	  <p  >I’ve had a medium amount of IT experience, both within school and outside of school. 
			In year 10 and year 11, I undertook data analysis and computing as an early start year 12 subject, there I learned a lot of the basics to do with IT while also gaining a lot of skills to help me with further education and life in general.
			I also participated in work experience at MARS Petcare where I worked with the IT department for two weeks handling small tasks and jobs so I could get an idea of what it was like to work in the IT field. 
	  </p> </div>
	<div class="column" > 
                        <p >I chose to come to RMIT because of the extensive and well-structured IT and computing courses that they had in place, allowing for me to pursue my interest in IT no matter what ATAR I got after leaving school.
			My brother also goes to RMIT, and he said that it’s a great environment to attend university and provides amazing resources to assist in me while undertaking my classes. 
	I expect to learn all about the different areas of IT throughout my course, not only to help me find a job when I’m older but to also build on my skills to use in everyday life. 
			I also want to use these studies to help me grow as a person and build my life skills by working with people I’ve never met before, overcoming challenges and learning new ways to tackle problems that I come across.	</p>

				<h1> <u> Ideal Job </u> </h1>
			</header>
			<p > My ideal job is being a systems administrator. It involves working with the computer systems of a business such as this one listed called Kyndryl.
			Being a systems administrator basically means  working with the day-to-day operations of the businesses computing side.  </p>
			<p > This can involve installing networks, building and managing operating systems and troubleshooting any problems that the computer systems come across. 
			This is appealing for me as I love to work on different systems and finding out how to fix them or make them function properly. 
			To be a candidate for this position there is a set of essential skills that are required to work for the business. </p>
			<p > These involve a fluent understanding of the AIX operating system, being able to work flexible hours and being able to work strongly both within a team and independently. 
			It also requires experience with AIX and Redhat Linux administration to be considered for a position. 
			To be required for this position at Kyndryl I would have to work in another position that uses AIX operating systems and allows me to gain a firm understanding on how to navigate and work on those systems.  </p>
			<p > If not, I would have to learn myself how to do it. Skills such as following duties, working as a team, being able to communicate easily and being flexible should be fairly easy as I believe I have a strong set of those skills and If I were to get the position at Kyndryl I think I would fit in pretty well.

		<div class="column"> <p> These results for me, I think ultimately, show me what I my strengths and weaknesses are and really simple detail while also suggesting how I can improve on them. 
			For example, my creativity test outlined that my creativity was a work in progress and stated that I should “Share your ideas and perspectives with others and ask them how they view problems.
			Adopt a collaborative approach to problem finding and work actively with others to create and innovate.” This pushes me to be more involved within a group setting. 
			Which I think closely relates to my other test results that stated that I had a more introverted personality and should explore the extroverted side of things.</p> </div>
		<div class="column"> <p>I think these tests will influence my behavior within a team as I will be aware of how I function towards others and myself. 
		As I am more introverted, I may find it a bit harder to put my own inputs in to the group, but once I feel comfortable around them and can open up, I know that I would be a good asset to the team. </p>
 
</div>
			<div class="column"> <p> It would be better that I am in a team that isn’t all exactly like me, because that way I would be able to learn how other people work in group settings and also learn how I work in different group settings. 
If everyone was introverted, it could be hard for things to get done properly without good group communication, whereas, if there a few extroverted group members, it would be easier for me to feel comfortable as it would boost my confidence when others include me. </p> </div>

					<h1> <u> Project Idea </u> </h1>
        			</header>
        			
        				<section>
        					<div class="row">
        					<div class="column"> <p> <b> Overview </b> <br> The project idea that I have a come up with, is an app that can scan the RFID chip inside key cards and key fobs and store the RFID information on a phone. 
                    This way, people won’t have to worry about accidentally leaving their key card or key fob at home and not being able to enter buildings, or other places that require a scanning entry.</p> </div>
        					<div class="column"> <p> <b> Motivation </b> <br>This app would be extremely useful because of how often we need to go in and out of buildings each day that require either a key card or key fob. 
                    In the past month I have experienced times where myself or others have gone to enter a building or room and have forgotten or don’t have access to a key card/fob. 
                  Experiences include, locking myself out of my apartment after leaving my keys inside, having to wait 30-45 minutes outside my Information technology tutorial room because my tutor didn’t have a key that could open the room. 
                  Having a single location where all the keys for all doors a stored on your phone that is taken everywhere would make it so much easier and is an efficient solution to the problem. </p> </div>
							<div class="column"> <p> <b> Description </b> <br> The app “Keychain” will allow people to scan their key cards or key fobs and store the RFID chip information directly onto their phone. This eliminates the need for people to carry around bulky and heavy lanyards that are filled with keys. 
              When the users need to then unlock a building or room to enter all they will have to do is open the app, select which key they want to use and then all they do is hold their phone up to the scanner which will then unlock the door and allow entry. 
            The App will allow people to store a max of 5 RFID chips as a base subscription.  </p> </div>
        				</section>
					<div class = "row">
						<div class="column"> <p> <b> Tool and Technologies </b> <br> The hardware needed, as mentioned before would only consist of a mobile device that has the capabilities of scanning RFID chips, which most mobile devices these days have. 
							iPhones from the 6th generation have NFC capabilities which allows the phone to pick up RFID chips and store data/information if needed. 
							Android mobile phones have also been fitted with NFC capabilities since 2012, which means it is unlikely that people don’t have access to the app due to device constraints. </P> </div>
						<div class="column"> <p> <b> Skills Required </b> <br> Due to most mobile phones nowadays being fitted with RFID scanning capabilities, elaborate software coding doesn’t need to be written. 
							Really, the only software that needs to be coded are the actions that the mobile phones must perform in order to scan and store RFID chips and then be able to bring up that information and data when someone needs to use a key. </p> </div>
						<div class="column"> <p> <b> Outcome </b> <br> If the project is successful, the outcome ultimately, will provide a much easier life for those who have to deal with entering rooms or buildings that require a key card.  
							It solves the original problem where people would have to carry around a lanyard full of different key fobs or key passes which just makes it far too bulky and annoying. 
							Having all the passes stored on a phone with no physical presence is just so much more practical. </p> </div>
